# Meet Teddy, the Test-Driven Development Agent

Teddy follows an iterative coding and testing process to systematically provide guarentees that the code will work. 

Requirements:
- For OpenAI users, grab an openAI api key and set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. 
- It will work with other providers with some minor code modifications to the model parameter. See Google-ADK samples and their LiteLLM examples. 

Setup:
- `pip install uv`
- `uv sync`

- `uv run teddy.py`
