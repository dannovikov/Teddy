Distance Calculation Module

Implemented a Python module 'toy_distance_module.py' providing a function 'haversine_distance' to calculate the great-circle distance between two geographic points using the Haversine formula.

The module includes validation for typical geographic coordinates and is thoroughly tested.

Test coverage includes:
- Zero distance (same point)
- Known distance between New York City and Chicago
- Antipodal points representing maximum possible distance on Earth

All tests have passed successfully, ensuring the correctness of the implementation.

This setup is now ready for deployment or further integration into larger systems.
